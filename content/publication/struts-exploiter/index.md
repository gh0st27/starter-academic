Apache Struts is a modern Java framework that uses the Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture for building enterprise-ready web applications. It uses OGNL - Object-Graph Navigation Language to interpret user supplied data.
Object Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) was developed to provide developers with an easy way to extract data from an object model but when the interpreter attempts to interpret user-supplied data without validation, it introduce critical security flaws.
Struts2Scanner is a python based vulnerability scanner to find out if a target endpoint is vulnerable OGNL injection. As of now it checks anginst following vulnerabilities.

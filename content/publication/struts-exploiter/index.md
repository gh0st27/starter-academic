title: Struts2Scanner
abstract: This exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache
  Struts versions < 2.2.0. This issue is caused by a failure to properly handle
  unicode characters in OGNL extensive expressions passed to the web server. By
  sending a specially crafted request to the Struts application it is possible
  to bypass the "#" restriction on ParameterInterceptors by using OGNL context
  variables. Bypassing this restriction allows for the execution of arbitrary
  Java code.

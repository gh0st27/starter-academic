abstract: This exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.2.0. This issue is caused by a failure to properly handle unicode characters in OGNL extensive expressions passed to the web server. By sending a specially crafted request to the Struts application it is possible to bypass the "#" restriction on ParameterInterceptors by using OGNL context variables. Bypassing this restriction allows for the execution of arbitrary Java code.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
